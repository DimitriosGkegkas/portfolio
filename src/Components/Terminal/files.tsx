${COLOR.magenta}## üë®‚Äçüéì About Me${COLOR.reset}

I'm ${COLOR.green}Dimitrios Gkegkas${COLOR.reset}, an Electrical & Computer Engineer 
with a strong passion for ${COLOR.cyan}robotics${COLOR.reset}, ${COLOR.cyan}AI${COLOR.reset}, and ${COLOR.cyan}immersive web experiences${COLOR.reset}.

With hands-on experience in:
- control systems
- multi-agent reinforcement learning
- 3D interaction (React Three Fiber, Three.js)
- CV pipelines and digitization

I aim to bridge the physical and digital worlds through technology.

Currently pursuing an international MSc through the ${COLOR.yellow}JEMARO${COLOR.reset} program,
I combine technical precision with creative design to build intelligent systems 
that enhance real-world applications.
